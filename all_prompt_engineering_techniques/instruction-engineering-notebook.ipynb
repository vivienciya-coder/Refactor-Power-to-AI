      "Climate change refers to significant and lasting changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, have accelerated this process since the late 19th century. This has led to increased greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide and methane, trapping heat in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequences of climate change include rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, sea-level rise, more frequent and severe weather events (like hurricanes and droughts), and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and promote sustainable practices.\n",

      "Clear Instruction Output:\n",
      "**Primary Causes of Climate Change:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** The combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation is the largest contributor, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).\n",
      "2. **Deforestation:** Trees absorb CO2, and large-scale deforestation reduces this capacity, while also releasing stored carbon.\n",
      "3. **Agricultural Practices:** Livestock production and certain agricultural methods contribute significant greenhouse gases, particularly methane and nitrous oxide.\n",
      "4. **Industrial Processes:** Manufacturing and chemical processes release various greenhouse gases and pollutants.\n",

      "**Effects of Climate Change:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Temperature Rise:** Global temperatures have increased, leading to more frequent and severe heatwaves.\n",
      "2. **Extreme Weather Events:** Increased intensity and frequency of hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires are observed.\n",
      "3. **Sea Level Rise:** Melting ice caps and glaciers, along with thermal expansion of water, contribute to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities.\n",
      "4. **Ecosystem Disruption:** Altered habitats lead to shifts in biodiversity, threatening species extinction and disrupting food webs.\n",

      "### How to Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Wash Your Hands**: Before you start, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to ensure cleanliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Gather Your Ingredients**:\n",
      "   - **Bread**: Choose whole grain or white bread, depending on your preference.\n",
      "   - **Peanut Butter**: Use creamy or crunchy natural peanut butter for a wholesome taste.\n",
      "   - **Jelly**: Opt for grape or strawberry jelly for a classic flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prepare Your Workspace**: Clear a clean surface on your kitchen counter and gather the following tools:\n",
      "   - A butter knife or spreading tool\n",
      "   - A clean plate\n",
      "   - A spoon (if needed for the jelly)\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Spread the Peanut Butter**: Take one slice of bread and use the butter knife to spread an even layer of peanut butter over one side. Be generous, but don’t overdo it—about 2 tablespoons is a good amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Spread the Jelly**: On the second slice of bread, use the clean side of your butter knife or a spoon to spread jelly evenly over the surface. Again, about 2 tablespoons should suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Combine the Slices**: Carefully place the peanut butter slice on top of the jelly slice, peanut butter side facing the jelly side, to create your sandwich.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Cut the Sandwich (Optional)**: If you prefer, you can cut the sandwich in half diagonally or vertically for easier handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Address Allergies**: Be mindful of potential allergies. If you or someone you are serving has a peanut allergy, consider using an alternative like sunflower seed butter or almond butter, and ensure that the jelly is free from any allergens.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Storage Tip**: If you’re not eating the sandwich immediately, wrap it in plastic wrap or place it in an airtight container to keep it fresh. Store it in the refrigerator if you want to extend its shelf life, especially if using perishable ingredients.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Enjoy**: Your peanut butter and jelly sandwich is ready to be enjoyed! Pair it with a glass of milk or a piece of fruit for a complete meal.\n",

      "### Lesson Plan: Introduction to Personal Finance for High School Students\n",
      "\n",
      "#### I. Introduction\n",
      "Personal finance is crucial for making informed decisions about money. Understanding how to budget, save, and manage credit can empower students to achieve their financial goals, avoid debt, and build a secure future. This lesson will introduce key concepts that every teenager should know to establish a strong financial foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### II. Key Topics to Cover\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Budgeting**\n",
      "   - **Explanation**: Budgeting involves tracking income and expenses to ensure that you live within your means. It helps you allocate funds for necessary expenses and savings.\n",
      "   - **Activity**: Create a simple monthly budget using a template. Students will list hypothetical income (e.g., allowance, part-time job) and expenses (e.g., entertainment, food) to see how they can plan their spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Saving**\n",
      "   - **Explanation**: Saving money is setting aside a portion of your income for future needs or emergencies. It teaches discipline and prepares you for unexpected expenses.\n",
      "   - **Activity**: Set a savings goal. Students will choose a short-term goal (e.g., a new phone) and calculate how much they need to save each week to reach that goal in three months.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Understanding Credit**\n",
      "   - **Explanation**: Credit is the ability to borrow money with the promise to pay it back later. Understanding credit scores is essential, as they can impact loan approvals and interest rates.\n",
      "   - **Activity**: Discuss common credit scenarios (like using a credit card) and have students role-play responsible versus irresponsible credit management.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Investing Basics**\n",
      "   - **Explanation**: Investing involves putting money into assets (like stocks) with the expectation of generating a profit over time. It’s important for building wealth.\n",
      "   - **Activity**: Simulate a stock market game where students choose stocks to \"invest\" in and track their performance over a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### III. Conclusion\n",
      "Understanding personal finance is key to making smart financial decisions. By budgeting, saving, and learning about credit, students can build a secure financial future. For further learning, consider resources like \"The Millionaire Next Door\" by Thomas J. Stanley or online platforms like Khan Academy’s personal finance section.\n"
